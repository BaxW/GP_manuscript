This repository contains code and drafts for my Hybrid Poplar Genomic Prediction manuscript 

All of the analyses and figures for the manuscript can be reproduced using the code contained here

Cross validation of the genomic prediction models is implemented in Snakemake. The sankefile located in the workflow directory can be used to recreate the cross validation, but users should note that it is designed to be run on a local HPC (UVM VACC), so partition names, wall time, cpu usage and other resource designations may need to be adjusted to run it elsewhere.
